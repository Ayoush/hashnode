## **Database Models**

A database model is a conceptual representation of data. It defines the structure of the data and the relationships between different entities. There are many different database models, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

The following are some of the most common database models:

* **Hierarchical model:** This model represents data as a tree structure, with each node having one parent and zero or more children. The hierarchical model is simple to understand and implement, but it is not very flexible.
    
    ![Hierarchical database model](https://s3.studytonight.com/curious/uploads/pictures/1690273187-1.png align="center")
    
* **Network model:** This model represents data as a network of nodes and links. Each node can have multiple parents and children. The network model is more flexible than the hierarchical model, but it is also more complex.
    
    ![Network database model](https://s3.studytonight.com/curious/uploads/pictures/1690273296-1.png align="left")
    
* **Entity-relationship (ER) model:** This model represents data as a collection of entities and the relationships between them. The ER model is the most flexible of the three models, and it is the most commonly used model for relational databases.
    
    ![Entity-relationship (ER) model](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bip/APOwr83GEo6oT3MrozKym1-WmXVkdmvbt0UWA4AWe-OpHzU9tuDvNZp6Npfydmm7wjabu2HUlOukVyftuRu7D5Wgrv98UcPmmgfNEoz8HuFV7qzy7uDKdhL3GgA5nCzt1Mt1LNEifhFYw3dFgQzuQn0=w250-h200-p align="center")
    
* **Object-oriented model:** This model represents data as objects and the relationships between them. The object-oriented model is similar to the ER model, but it is more object-oriented.

## **Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagrams**

An ER diagram is a graphical representation of an ER model. It uses a set of symbols to represent entities, attributes, and relationships.

The following are the basic symbols used in ER diagrams:

* **Entity:** An entity is a real-world object or concept that is represented in the database. Entities are represented by rectangles.
    
    ![Entity symbol in ER diagram](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bip/APOwr82MqOYdmycqthAR7GZlhfnm_C3cix1ZPh1dwyZCvpEpURzMoNO4DN6Q5Vs6izKuSzkxt6w0nM6SO5ojWKxKmQB1t9yoaZljXElZDVUUCsJWBclrLjxggvXrC5C8AKH4g8j5AwnHbT5Mh7qGKe9EhiXB=w250-h200-p align="center")
    
* **Attribute:** An attribute is a characteristic of an entity. Attributes are represented by ovals.
    
    ![Attribute symbol in ER diagram](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bip/APOwr82MqOYdmycqthAR7GZlhfnm_C3cix1ZPh1dwyZCvpEpURzMoNO4DN6Q5Vs6izKuSzkxt6w0nM6SO5ojWKxKmQB1t9yoaZljXElZDVUUCsJWBclrLjxggvXrC5C8AKH4g8j5AwnHbT5Mh7qGKe9EhiXB=w250-h200-p align="center")
    
* **Relationship:** A relationship is a connection between two entities. Relationships are represented by diamonds.
    
    ![Relationship symbol in ER diagram](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bip/APOwr82MqOYdmycqthAR7GZlhfnm_C3cix1ZPh1dwyZCvpEpURzMoNO4DN6Q5Vs6izKuSzkxt6w0nM6SO5ojWKxKmQB1t9yoaZljXElZDVUUCsJWBclrLjxggvXrC5C8AKH4g8j5AwnHbT5Mh7qGKe9EhiXB=w250-h200-p align="center")
    

The following are some of the most common types of relationships:

* **One-to-one relationship:** A one-to-one relationship is a relationship between two entities where each entity in the first entity can have only one corresponding entity in the second entity, and vice versa.
    
    ![One-to-one relationship in ER diagram](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bip/APOwr819cZbK13y9z-6DjWSTg1epWVSPy7gDNKaXhgkgR7MBIUclEZd2a0VpE_s8EVdabkPbggNjgR-E6O96ySwA8jIgKlfr5lo=w250-h200-p align="center")
    
* **One-to-many relationship:** A one-to-many relationship is a relationship between two entities where each entity in the first entity can have zero or more corresponding entities in the second entity, but each entity in the second entity can only have one corresponding entity in the first entity.
    
    ![One-to-many relationship in ER diagram](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bip/APOwr82VIVJyH0cyaXDYD_DzeZFshcvXNuz7TZwIYcFGjKI_L2vr7UpKrmqp9mDQcFXzA7UzQXNMkRTg8hzERGeCCAjDIx62XQc9zpxDowuE6bdOT6lN-Ks_uZ901XdNCvFQ9cWbusxuqSm5WkdibxfmLnXUG8tzyWHcA3c=w250-h200-p align="center")
    
    **Many-to-many relationship:** A many-to-many relationship is a relationship between two entities where each entity in the first entity can have zero or more corresponding entities in the second entity, and vice versa.
    
    ![Many-to-many relationship in ER diagram](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bip/APOwr819-3qdtVXpTgUs9YgfJiwKIOVNL6FgXxM14bjJLYHFomCYfAa6dwqAt45Nq_XDbcJ9CT15mEmAnupnYNi9E3v9jb9UM7UYu1ctL2xjjgezIxQdP9zyGaxVW-F_o6taJd8wWNQ83rUbQ38x2t0BFDJdw3g--8IfXbV34u6XRya3zYb7l0s=w250-h200-p align="center")
    

ER diagrams are a powerful tool for designing databases. They can be used to visualize the data and relationships in a database, and they can help to ensure that the database is designed correctly.

## **Relationships and Enhanced ER**

In addition to the basic types of relationships, there are also some enhanced ER modelling concepts:

* **Specialization/generalization:** This is a way of grouping entities that share common attributes and relationships. The common attributes and relationships are defined in the general entity, and the specific entities inherit them.
    
    ![Specialization/generalization in ER diagram](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bip/APOwr81bIGdVWuvew1zy2Wsn_WA9u1Ck-JX6KvTDInl13LJq8EOUoABNvBpPy6ZoApME9nzMImuUh4GzxtIyDSQbkP4wYbtWqPIopoJIKlCCM5Q_leE9irbsiKTEicdJNQ1B8qwwqTJV-ho3ZUGbYXO4q_xbU63Ctn2VVTs=w250-h200-p align="center")
    
* **Aggregation:** This is a way of representing a whole-part relationship between two entities. The whole entity is represented by a single entity, and the parts are represented by child entities.
    
    ![Aggregation in ER diagram](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bip/APOwr803pAj4uRgn86P3e_s4ycEAGYTxlIUjFoLyyhrzbhjx0RTXJN3v5fSnTR22bfv9UW0YbUf7bGd7Tt6MCsc6cOk3L8kiOq4YJ2kWaAPp_8bxqI393DGsYSbmTJw2yGcln2YWttnQgAs0G1ReYCjYTcz38b4fk6Y=w250-h200-p align="center")
    
* **Association:** This is a weaker form of relationship than the other types of relationships. It represents an interaction between two entities, but it does not imply any ownership or containment.
    
    ![Association in ER diagram](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bip/APOwr80n-kfygVCyIKQAsPF1_ndnTkwWllE4DJS8rLhnSeKne5LyebyXZl0UsSGoa1n37Tg9eaCJPvnbWsMXoVkOUNQHUW8B19rp1fnK1zPOaa2tntfCXVrdJbSGrqk3y_YUGBag-6fpJB9VDLInSlceLTs0TvB3wPc1L2yQXM7q-ROvqvOvvONiksmkJ2btFejxIQ=w250-h200-p align="center")
    

These enhanced ER modelling concepts can be used to create more complex and flexible database models.

## **Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)**

A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a software system that is used to create, maintain, and query relational databases. RDBMSs provide several features that make them powerful and versatile tools for managing data:

* **Data abstraction:** RDBMSs provide a layer of abstraction between the data and the user. This means that the user does not need to know how the data is physically stored in the database.
    
* **Data integrity:** RDBMSs enforce data integrity constraints to ensure that the data in the database is accurate and consistent.
    
* **Data security:** RDBMSs provide security features to protect the data from unauthorized access.
    
* **Data scalability:** RDBMSs can be scaled to handle large amounts of data.
    
* **Data availability:** RDBMSs provide features to ensure that the data is always available to users.
    
* **Query language:** RDBMSs provide a query language, such as SQL, that can be used to retrieve data from the database.
    

**Benefits of using an RDBMS:**

* RDBMSs are easy to use and manage.
    
* RDBMSs are scalable and can handle large amounts of data.
    
* RDBMSs are secure and can protect data from unauthorized access.
    
* RDBMSs are reliable and can ensure that data is always available.
    
* RDBMSs provide a variety of features for querying and analyzing data.
    

**Real-world examples of databases:**

## **Database Architecture**

Database architecture is how the database is organized and stored. It consists of the following layers:

* **Storage layer:** The storage layer is the physical layer of the database. It is where the data is actually stored.
    
    ![Storage layer](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bip/APOwr831zVWa0PEw7wxLRT2IAcBIOIBvBaClukluapT-24HsjoXGYrL-zr39osii7H9LbKi8zDdHhI5BPZ80BmPbJXGsc7TSjubO_ikGk0CfDQ1uhsE_DVnT2Bqg9sOxLpjTgiVoen7qG07tnim9XW0WqkzxBV1lMikvmu4Ha7E0oWag1-zl18WdKhFcDXo7PyH5BYCExzb-_CeV1UzwB3UX17ZJ-HAy4qmGlzpXlLerrxGcIo45oZ1TcyCjcEvVeM9SuBJ-QOaiKgivatom1eaXiWfdPQqj4rulW0WQSrJXwA=w250-h200-p align="center")
    
* **Query processing layer:** The query processing layer is responsible for processing queries against the database.
    
    ![Query processing layer](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bip/APOwr822VKg0wbWTBeTmeDZuGPCyC9io1Nz-yAovwX424m6dGcMxH57TsxSHKrG0S0sKD5DZSMuhbR83FRJxCQwmzYyiod4=w250-h200-p align="center")
    
* **Indexing layer:** The indexing layer is responsible for creating and maintaining indexes on the data. Indexes make it faster to retrieve data from the database.
    
    ![Indexing layer](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bip/APOwr83sozV5puHy_1dLJKanaNs0jqTHqItMpldAz695TI-c89bnMlIrrZeubEUZYIdZ7oAaUiMhzbRqChI5dkeG7apS0fpQFB7D2HARfmIZJwpCjPkY2P9Pcrym8zTSvYJ0b4kgJJBzP522=w250-h200-p align="center")
    
* **Transaction management layer:** The transaction management layer is responsible for ensuring that transactions are executed correctly. A transaction is a unit of work that must be completed either successfully or not at all.
    
    ![Transaction management layer](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bip/APOwr82y1ZtSiCPlZaVVarBmWHqdPAzSTdKJ5ptl1uZNecUOd0iL-pvAm9Es5reKVHOBn5Wg-fhWZHChxjBjuWd-1ycaYvlJvL-64RlYD9cZIQtJ1GkEUY_kakz3iPp2HjzGGe3siy1NdUGHceiyRw6JjcNDhc2cPMgrDsIxMHiOL5H47ZI4colr37-bKq4EQXM-ZIk4sFqkWggIaNOG3Y167Kiq2eGyabq_6AZfEZZ4OVZUcDK_Bl-hd8PN1svDctfG9iVNJX2jGPzgTTfqoaqsQ6Z1Udmc_Z00tFaRNj2E=w250-h200-p align="center")
