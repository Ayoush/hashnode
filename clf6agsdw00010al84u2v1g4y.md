As we embark on the journey of personal growth and development, it is important to set goals that challenge us and help us grow. This week, I have set some ambitious goals for myself that I am excited to share with you. My plan is to complete the book Inner Engineering, learn NodeJS, and engage in physical activity by going to the gym, walking, running 5km, and cycling 10km. In addition, I am starting a 100-day gym challenge that includes going to the gym for 100 consecutive days, following a diet for 100 continuous days, and doing 100 push-ups and 100 crunches for the next 50 days. After that, I will also include 100 pull-ups every day. Today is day one of the challenge, and I will upload my progress daily.

1. ## Completing Inner Engineering:
    

Inner Engineering is a powerful book that can help us achieve inner peace, balance, and harmony. To complete the book by the end of the week, I plan to set aside dedicated time each day for reading. I will read the book in the morning before starting my workday, as I find that this helps set a positive tone for the day ahead. By staying committed to a daily reading schedule, I am confident that I will be able to complete the book and gain valuable knowledge.

1. ## Learning NodeJS:
    

As a software developer, I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with new technologies. This week, I have set a goal to learn NodeJS, a popular programming language used in web development. To achieve this goal, I will dedicate a couple of hours each day to studying NodeJS. I plan to start by watching online tutorials and reading articles that provide an introduction to the language. As I become more familiar with NodeJS, I will work on small projects to apply my knowledge and improve my skills.

1. ## Engaging in physical activity:
    

Physical activity is an essential part of maintaining good health and well-being. This week, I have set a goal to engage in regular physical activity by going to the gym, walking, running 5km, and cycling 10km. To achieve this goal, I will set aside time each day for physical activity. I plan to go to the gym in the morning, take a walk or run during my lunch break, and cycle in the evening. By committing to a daily exercise routine, I am confident that I will improve my fitness and feel better mentally and physically.

## Staying on track:

To stay on track with my goals, I plan to set reminders and create a schedule that outlines the specific times and activities that I will be engaging in each day. I will use a calendar and reminder app to help me stay organized and on track. Additionally, I will track my progress by keeping a journal and using a fitness app that tracks my exercise routines and progress.

# Starting the 100-day gym challenge:

Today is day one of my 100-day gym challenge, which includes going to the gym for 100 consecutive days, following a diet for 100 continuous days, and doing 100 push-ups and 100 crunches for the next 50 days. After that, I will also include 100 pull-ups every day. I am excited to see the progress I will make and the benefits that will come from this challenge. I plan to upload my progress daily to keep myself accountable and motivated.
